/*
 * NOTE: SVG inlined into the page for interactivity purposes requires some
 *       additional CSS to work properly. The @namespace rule and svg| prefix
 *       are required for the CSS to be applied to the SVG elements.
 *
 *       Vite does not support CSS @namespace rules, so we also have to ensure
 *       the @namespace rule for SVG is included _at the top of the CSS file_
 *       produced by the build process. See cssns.css for that rule.
 *
 *       The Vite build process will warn about unsupported @namespace, but
 *       the resulting application still handles the SVG correctly.
